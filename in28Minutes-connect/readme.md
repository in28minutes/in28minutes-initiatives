## Aim

- Give you a platform to share your expertise

	- With this platform, you get the opportunity to (possibly) share your vision, passion and knowledge with  43,000 Subscribers on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/rithustutorials) and 100,000 Students on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/user/in28minutes/)
- Create Great Programmers from India
	- There are awesome programmers from India doing great work across the world. However, as a percentage of IT professionals, the number of awesome programmers remains miniscule.
- Promote Online Learning in India
	- We think Online Learning is a great socio economic leveller. Online learning has come a long way in the last few years around the world. However, adoption in India remains slow and we want to increase adoption by bringing online learning at an early stage - college and industry entry level. We belive once you start learning online, it will remain your No 1 choice of learning.
- Give Learners exposure to 
	- Behind the scenes look at you - stories, lessons, beliefs and vision!
	- What's happening in the industry?
	- How can they adapt?

## Our Beliefs

- Be passionate about what your do!
- While we are creating great learning experiences with our courses, we think a real mindset change happens only when a learner gets a chance to interact with experts - who are passionate and doing great work.
- As an online instructor, we should engage and care for our students.
